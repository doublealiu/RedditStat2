# RedditStat
A python script that controls a reddit bot. The bot will read data (specified in config) and write that data to a database. Features include:
 * tracking upvotes over time
 * tracking frequently used words or emoji
 * tracking which subreddits reach the frontpage (r/all)
 * tracking frequency of activity on specified subreddits

## Dependencies
RedditStat uses [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to have PRAW, PyYAML, schedule, and mysql-connector installed. 
```
pip3 install praw --upgrade
pip3 install pyyaml --upgrade
pip3 install schedule --upgrade
pip3 install mysql-connector --upgrade
```
If ```pip3``` does not work, use ```pip```. 

## Reddit Instance
To use RedditStat, you will need a reddit account with a custom "developed application" added. 
1. Create an account on reddit, or sign in. The username is not important as RedditStat is read-only.
2. In https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/, click *create another app...* 
3. Select the *script* option and put a basic description and name. Click *create app.*
4. Your ```client_id``` is under the heading "personal use script" while ```client_secret``` is next to "secret."

## Configuration
Most configuration features are implemented in the example config.yml file below:
```
database:
# Database section is required
# Database is compatible with most modern implementations of mysql (8.0 / phpmyadmin)
  host: test.com #can be an IP address or URL
  database-name: test
  username: root
  password: password

subreddits:
  linuxmasterrace: #subreddit name (string after /r/)
    submissions: 50 #select 50 submissions
    timing: 60 #get data every 60 seconds
    sort-by-section: hot #hot, top, controversial; defaults to hot if not any of those
    sort-by-time: today #only works with controversial and top; hour, day, week, month, year, all

track-posts:
  # obtain a post url: ex. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/61oly8/new_read_me_first/
  61oly8: 20 # post ID is always the 6 character string after "/comments/." Will refresh every 20 seconds

reddit:
#Reddit section is required (refer to subheading Reddit Instance)
  client-id: dsds
  client-secret: dsa
  user-agent: dsafvfd # not dependent for program execution
```
## Installation and Running
Please download all .py and .yml files and move them to a preferred directory. Note that all python files must be in the same directory. After configuring and saving config.yml, your program is ready to run.

To run in the foreground (your program will stop if you close the terminal window):
```python3 /path/to/main.py``` or ```python /path/to/main.py``` if you only have Python 3 installed on your computer.

To run in the background, you will need to use ```nohup```:
```nohup python3 /path/to/main.py &``` or ```nohup python /path/to/main.py &```
